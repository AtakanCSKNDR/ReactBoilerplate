# What is boilerplate

# Getting Started

Vue-Boilerplate requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and run the project in development.

```sh

$ npm install
$ npm start
```

ReactBoilerplate uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - Framework for building user interfaces.
* [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) - Ant Design is a UI Library.
